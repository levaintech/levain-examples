## Levain Templates

Levain templates are a collection of pre-built use cases that can be used to quickly create a new project from the
command line or within the Levain Launchpad (https://app.levain.tech).

### For Levainians

#### Adding & Managing Templates

Examples (`./examples/*`) that have frontmatter and `template:` configured will be compatible with the Levain Launchpad
launcher.
This means that you can create a new project from the Levain Launchpad and select the example you want to start with
after whitelisting the example.
For more information on the available frontmatter options, see the `./examples/contented.config.mjs` file.

Accompanying prose should be added in the `README.md` as you would for any other project describing the example and how
to use it. The list of plugins for parsing and compiling the `README.md` is available in
the `./examples/contented.config.mjs` file.

> https://examples-frontmatter.levain.app contains all the examples and templates with prose compiled and rendered.

## Read the Docs

Levain examples are built on top of the Levain APIs. To learn more about the Levain APIs, check out
